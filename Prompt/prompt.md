## **📌 Suggested Charting Techniques for Subtopics**  
You can use these visualization techniques for any subtopic where they are most effective:  

### **1️⃣ Radial Diagram (Spoke Diagram)**  
- A central circle representing the **main system**, with branches extending outward to its components.  
- **Best for:** Showing parts in relation to the main system.  

### **2️⃣ Hierarchical Tree Diagram**  
- A **top-down** or **left-right** structure where the system branches into different subsystems.  
- **Best for:** Breaking down components into categories.  

### **3️⃣ Mind Map**  
- A central concept with **major branches** (e.g., ignition system, cooling system) and sub-branches.  
- **Best for:** Brainstorming or breaking down complex structures.  

### **4️⃣ Exploded View Diagram**  
- A **3D/2D** diagram showing all components slightly separated but still aligned.  
- **Best for:** Understanding how parts fit together.  

### **5️⃣ Sankey Diagram**  
- A **flow-based** diagram showing how different parts interact.  
- **Best for:** Process or energy flow visualization.  

### **6️⃣ Cluster Diagram**  
- A **bubble-like** structure grouping related components together.  
- **Best for:** Understanding relationships between different elements.  

### **7️⃣ Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram)**  
- A **horizontal structure** with diagonal branches representing major sections, each further dividing into specific parts.  
- **Best for:** Cause-and-effect analysis or structured breakdowns.
