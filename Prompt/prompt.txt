Initial Request:
"I want to create an interactive study guide similar to the turbocharger one, but for [{TOPIC NAME}]. Please maintain the same level of interactivity and visual appeal but with a different color scheme. Here's what I'm providing:"
Reference Materials:


"Here's the code for the turbocharger guide for reference: [PASTED_CODE]"
"Here's a screenshot of how it looks: [SCREENSHOT 1][screenshot2]"
"Here's the content for [{Topic Name}]: [CONTENT GOES BELOW]"

---------------------------------CONTENT --------------------


----------------contnet ends--------------



Specific Requirements:
"Please include:


All interactive features (expanding sections, scroll to top, quick review)
Image section with modal view capability
Memory aid section
A different but eye-friendly color scheme
Mobile responsiveness
Student-friendly learning features"


Content Organization:
"For the content, please organize it into these key areas:


Quick glance overview
Core concepts
Working mechanism
Components/Parts
Technical details
Key points to remember
Visual aids
Feel free to modify section names based on the topic's requirements."


NOTES :
ALSO INCLUDE OTHER KEY ASPECTS, WORKING , AND OTHER IMPORTANT  TOPICS

YOU CAN INCLUDE THESE ALL CHARTING TECHINQUES FOR ANY SUB TOPIC WHICH YOU LIKE
1. Radial Diagram (Spoke Diagram)
A circle in the center representing the engine, with multiple branches (lines) extending outward to smaller circles or labels for each component (e.g., piston, crankshaft, valves).
Good for showing parts in relation to the main system.
2. Hierarchical Tree Diagram
A top-down or left-right structure, with the engine at the top or left, branching into different subsystems (e.g., fuel system, cooling system, transmission).
Best for showing subdivisions of engine components.
3. Mind Map
The engine in the center, branching into major sections like the combustion system, lubrication system, etc. Each branch further divides into specific parts.
Great for brainstorming or breaking down complex structures.
4. Exploded View Diagram
A 3D or 2D diagram where all components are shown slightly separated but in alignment, so you can see how parts fit together.
Used in technical manuals and engineering drawings.
5. Sankey Diagram
A flow-based diagram where the engine is at one end, and components are represented as arrows flowing from it, showing how different parts interact.
Good for showing energy or process flow.
6. Cluster Diagram
Similar to a bubble chart, where the engine is at the center, and different parts are represented as connected bubbles.
Best for grouping related components together.
7. Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram)
A horizontal line as the engine's main structure, with diagonal branches representing major sections (e.g., ignition, cooling, fuel), and each branch further splitting into smaller parts.
Great for cause-and-effect analysis or structured breakdowns.
